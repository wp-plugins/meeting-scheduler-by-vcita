"vCita not only allows my patients to view my schedule and book appointments online 24/7, but even more importantly it allows referring physicians and surgeons to book their patients into my schedule before leaving their office.  Once an appointment is booked, we're able to contact them within seconds and engage in an online dialogue that is a huge convenience to them.  The best practice tool I've used in 25 years of practice." <BR>
